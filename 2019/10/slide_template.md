# [fit] **Code Of Conduct**
# [fit] *`ruby.org.au/code-of-conduct`*
# [fit] *`ruby.org.au/committee-members`*
# [fit] *`conduct@ruby.org.au`*

^
If this is your first RORO, or if you were previously unaware, Ruby Australia events are run under a code of conduct.<br />
This is the link where you can find it and have a read, but in summary we want this meetup to provide a friendly and welcoming environment for everyone who attends, and harassment of any kind is not tolerated.<br />
If you have any issues you want to raise about anything that has happened at a RORO, you can talk to any of the organisers who are Paul and Rob, or you can go straight to a Ruby Australia committee member if you don't think you can reach out to a RORO organiser.<br />

^
For those of you that haven't noticed, I'm not Rob or Paul, I'm Mat and I've volunteered to help out with
some of the organising, which means you now have three people begging you for roro talks instead of two, lucky you!

# [fit] **Thanks** **_to our_**
# [fit] **Sponsors**

^
RORO has many sponsors, without which these meetups would not be possible.

^
If you're Twitter-inclined please let tonight's speakers know how much you appreciate the work they put in by tweeting about it. Giving feedback definitely makes the speakers feel their efforts have made an impact beyond building their own presentation portfolio. Don't forget to mention rorosyd to tie the night altogether.

---

# [fit] *Who's* **New?**
# [fit] *Say* **Hello!** :wave:

^
So if you're new to Roro can you please put up your hand, don't worry we're not going to make you stand up or say anything.  Everyone have a look around at any new people standing near you with their hands up. We're going to have a 5 minute break, so please welcome them, and we'll kick off the talks.

# [fit] *Next Meetup's* Exercism
# [fit] **Simple Cipher**

# [fit] *`exercism download --exercise=simple-cipher --track=ruby`*

^
Next months challenge is Implement a simple shift cipher like Caesar and a more secure substitution cipher.

---

```
ABCDEFGHI...

WXYZABCDE...

HIGH -> ciper -> DECD

```

^
Caesers cipher was a shift cipher where the order of the alphabet is changed and using that new order
you encode the word you want to hide with that new alphabet ordering
So HIGH becomes DECD

---

# [fit] **Thank you!**

^
Thanks so much to all the speakers tonight, and if anyone is interested in giving a talk at a future RORO...

# [fit] *We are always looking for*
# [fit] **SPEAKERS!**

^
We are looking for speakers!
- We want *you* to present something at RORO because presenting at RORO is a win/win situation. You, the speaker, practice a skill and learn new things, and we, the audience, leverage your knowledge to learn new things that can potentially help us.<br />
- It's great public speaking practice in front of an audience that wants you to succeed because we're all here to learn cool new things, and...<br />
- Any talk you present here is great fodder for your resume and portfolio, and just by virtue of presenting, everyone will think you're an expert, which will surely lead to at least an endorsement on LinkedIn<br />
- So if you've got something to say, or to show and tell, that you think the Ruby community would love to hear about...

---

# [fit] *Something for everyone*
[.build-lists: true]

- Games in DragonRuby
- Cross-platform apps using RubyMotion
- Chatbots in Stealth
- Ruby-based blockchain for ROROSyd Bucks(tm)

^
Here are a few topics that might peak your interest. I don't know anything about these things, and I'd bet there are a bunch of people in the audience including myself that would love
to see how they work, you could be that person and be showered in ficticious and potentially volatile ROROSyd Bucks.

---


# [fit] **Where do I sign up?**

- :globe_with_meridians: *`github.com/rails-oceania/roro/issues`*
- *`@paulfioravanti`*
- *`@robcornish`*
- *:email: `rorosydmeetup@gmail.com`*

^
- Open up an issue at the RORO Github repo and tell us about the talk you want to submit, or feel free to message any of the organisers.<br />
- The repo has presentation requests added, so check them out if you're looking for an idea to do a talk about.
- Remember, It is *good* to throw yourself out of your comfort zone and try
something different, and who knows, you might even end up liking it and wanting
to do more.<br />
- Also, if you need any help creating or critiquing your presentation or want someone to do a dry run, then please feel free to approach any of the RORO organisers and we're happy to help you in any way we can to make you look awesome up on stage.

# [fit] *We are always looking for*
# [fit] **VENUES!**

^
These days we are also always looking for venues! If you or your company think you would like to give hosting a RORO meetup a shot, we would love to hear from you.<br />
There are no obligations, strings attached, or guilt-trips given about hosting RORO regularly, or even more than once.<br />
A one off is great and is appreciated, we'd also really love to find a permanent home for the next 6-12 months
If you've got a space big enough to host about 50-60 odd people, access to a projector, ability to have food delivered, maybe even a drinks fridge, and the desire to go down in the annuls of RORO Sydney as one of our awesome sponsors, then we should definitely talk.
We're looking for a December Venue and any month from March 2020, so if you want to host the final RORO of the year, please reach out to RORO organisers.

Offering: say your name, your company name, a sentence on what you do. And a sentence on who you're looking for - juniors, mids, seniors etc

# [fit] **We're looking for more**
## [fit] *HELP!*

^
As mentioned last month we're (I say we're like I've been doing this the whole time) still looking for one more person to help out with running RORO
I'm assuming it's very rewarding endeavour and the friends you make and experience you gain is invaluable.
If you think you have what it takes, or even if you don't think you do, you probably do and don't even realise it. Come and speak to Paul, Rob or myself or reach out through one of the online channels and we can start the first stage of the 10 stage interview process beginning with a whiteboard exercise. No seriously, if you keen and passionate we'll probably just say, over to you.
I passed my technical interview with flying colours, they only made me cry a few times.
